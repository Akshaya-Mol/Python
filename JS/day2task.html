<!-- You are building a simple library system. Each book has a title, an author, and a year of publication. You want to create a small program that stores a book's details and provides a method to display its information in a neat sentence.

Your task:

Create an object named book with properties: title, author, and year.

Inside the object, add a method called getSummary that returns a sentence like:
"The book 'The Alchemist' was written by Paulo Coelho in 1988."

Write a function called printBookSummary(bookObj) that takes the book object as a parameter and displays the book summary using the method. -->

        console.log(bookobj.getSummary())
